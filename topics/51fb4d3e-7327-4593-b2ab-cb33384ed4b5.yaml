  I am Manas Garg. My twitter handle is
  [@manasgarg](https://www.twitter.com/manasgarg). I have been working in the
  area of machine learning for some time now. I don't specialize in data
  science. My background is software engineering and I picked up the necessary
  knowledge and skills as this discipline evolved. I currently work as Director,
  Machine Learning at Adobe.


  I see that a lot of people approach Machine Learning without building the
  necessary foundation in mathematics. Part of the reason is the nature of
  mathematics itself and part of the reason is lack of approachable
  explanations. And finally, because these are all abstract concepts, people
  quickly forget what they studied.


  This book is my humble attempt to share some of the knowledge I have acquired
  and the point of view I built as I got comfortable with this area.
