  Probability is fundamental to statistics, data science, machine learning,
  artificial intelligence and several other buzzwords that people are fascinated
  about. Within the borader field of probability, distributions is a key
  mathematical construct with wide range of applicability. The whole world of
  inferential statistics is based on the concept of probability distributions.
  Beyond the inferential statistics, the probability distributions keep showing
  up in a surpring number of ways. When people say that a solid foudnation in
  `probability` is required to grok machine learning, the reference is to
  `probability distributions` and not the probability one studied in high
  school.
